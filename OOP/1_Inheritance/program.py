# Use inheritance to reuse an implementation: 
# Your derived classes should leverage most of their base class 
# implementation. They must also model an is a relationship. 
# A Customer class might also have an id and a name, but a Customer 
# is not an Employee, so you should not use inheritance.

# Implement an interface to be reused: When you want your class 
# to be reused by a specific part of your application, you implement 
# the required interface in your class, but you donâ€™t need to 
# provide a base class, or inherit from another class.
